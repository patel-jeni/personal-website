      "title": "Professional Tennis",
      "body": "My journey began on the sun‑lit tennis courts, where I spent years competing on the professional circuit. Tennis taught me more than technique. It shaped my character. Through long practices, hard‑fought matches, and the rhythm of constant improvement, I learned discipline, resilience, and the power of a focused mind. Every point demanded strategy, adaptability, and composure - qualities I never imagined would one day guide me into an entirely new world."

    "transition": {
      "title": "A Leap into Technology",
      "body": "Choosing to transition from professional athletics to technology was both daunting and exhilarating. I traded rackets for keyboards, early‑morning training sessions for late‑night debugging, and found myself captivated by the creative logic of software development. As I immersed myself in learning to code, I discovered something familiar: the same determination that fueled my life on the court could be redirected into building things - things that solve problems, spark impact, and reach people at a scale I had never experienced before."

      "title": "Software Engineer at Microsoft",
      "body": "Today, I’m a Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I design and build scalable systems used by millions. The lessons from my athletic career remain with me in every line of code: stay curious, strive for excellence, and never stop improving. Engineering, like tennis, is about showing up with intention — solving problems with clarity, learning from each challenge, and steadily refining your craft."

    "mindfulness": {
      "title": "Mindfulness, Nature & Balance",
      "body": "Outside of work, I recharge through meditation and quiet moments spent in nature. These practices help me stay grounded and remind me of the importance of being fully present—something tennis first taught me and engineering continues to reinforce. Whether I’m debugging a service or simply pausing to breathe, I carry the same calm determination and the belief that growth happens one mindful step at a time."
